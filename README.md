# SofaSpud

*SofaSpud* is a personal project for my home theatre set. It will provide a web interface for me to add shows and movies to my download list. For TV-shows it'll download torrents with new episodes automatically and start Transmission after download is complete. Movies are downloaded using torrents from ThePirateBay using Transmission. After the download is complete Transmission will notify XMBC and update the library.

## Features:

* Automatic downloading of torrent files to a specified directory
* Movie & TV-show sorting and renaming
* Quality options to download the best available
* Download subtitles from [OpenSubtitles.org](http://www.opensubtitles.org)
* Show movie information using [TMDb](http://www.themoviedb.org)
* Show TV-show and episode information using [TheTVDB](http://www.thetvdv.com)
